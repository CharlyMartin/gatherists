# The Gatherists

As part of my "developer MBA" (see [Leap of Code](https://www.mirhamasala.com/leap-of-code)), I wanted to create a web page for an existing brand _with_ the help of a designer.

I chose [The Gatherists](https://www.instagram.com/thegatherists/) as the brand, and asked Laura Crompton to design the page.
